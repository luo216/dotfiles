NAME

    rainbarf - CPU/RAM/battery stats chart bar for tmux (and GNU screen)

VERSION

    version 1.4

SYNOPSIS

     rainbarf --tmux --width 40 --no-battery

DESCRIPTION

    Fancy resource usage charts to put into the tmux
    <http://tmux.sourceforge.net/> status line. The CPU utilization history
    chart is tinted with the following colors to reflect the system memory
    allocation:

      * green: free memory;

      * yellow: active memory;

      * blue: inactive memory;

      * red: wired memory on Mac OS X / FreeBSD; "unaccounted" memory on
      Linux;

      * cyan: cached memory on Linux, buf on FreeBSD.

      * magenta: used swap memory.

    If available, battery charge is displayed on the right.

    screenshots.

USAGE

 Installation

      * Traditional way:

       perl Build.PL
       ./Build test
       ./Build install

      * Homebrew <http://brew.sh/> way:

       brew install rainbarf

      * MacPorts <http://www.macports.org/> way:

       port install rainbarf

      * CPAN way:

       cpan -i App::rainbarf

      * Modern Perl way:

       cpanm git://github.com/creaktive/rainbarf.git

 Configuration

    Add the following line to your ~/.tmux.conf file:

     set-option -g status-utf8 on
     set -g status-right '#(rainbarf)'

    Or, under GNOME Terminal:

     set-option -g status-utf8 on
     set -g status-right '#(rainbarf --rgb)'

    Reload the tmux config by running tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf.

CONFIGURATION FILE

    ~/.rainbarf.conf can be used to persistently store "OPTIONS":

     # example configuration file
     width=20   # widget width
     bolt       # fancy charging character
     remaining  # display remaining battery
     rgb        # 256-colored palette

    "OPTIONS" specified via command line override that values.
    Configuration file can be specified via RAINBARF environment variable:

     RAINBARF=~/.rainbarf.conf rainbarf

OPTIONS

    --help

      This.

    --[no]battery

      Display the battery charge indicator. Enabled by default.

    --[no]remaining

      Display the time remaining until the battery is fully charged/empty.
      See "CAVEAT". Disabled by default.

    --[no]bolt

      Display even fancier battery indicator. Disabled by default.

    --[no]bright

      Tricky one. Disabled by default. See "CAVEAT".

    --[no]rgb

      Use the RGB palette instead of the system colors. Also disabled by
      default, for the same reasons as above.

    --fg COLOR_NAME

      Force chart foreground color.

    --bg COLOR_NAME

      Force chart background color.

    --[no]loadavg

      Use load average <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_(computing)>
      metric instead of CPU utilization. You might want to set the --max
      threshold since this is an absolute value and has varying ranges on
      different systems. Disabled by default.

    --[no]swap

      Display the swap usage. Used swap amount is added to the total
      amount, but the free swap amount is not! Disabled by default.

    --max NUMBER

      Maximum loadavg you expect before rescaling the chart. Default is 1.

    --order INDEXES

      Specify the memory usage bar order. The default is fwaic ( free,
      wired, active, inactive & cached ).

    --[no]tmux

      Force tmux colors mode. By default, rainbarf detects automatically if
      it is being called from tmux or from the interactive shell.

    --screen

      screen(1)
      <http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man1/screen.1.html> colors
      mode. Experimental. See "CAVEAT".

    --width NUMBER

      Chart width. Default is 38, so both the chart and the battery
      indicator fit the tmux status line. Higher values may require
      disabling the battery indicator or raising the status-right-length
      value in ~/.tmux.conf.

    --datfile FILENAME

      Specify the file to log CPU stats to. Default: $HOME/.rainbarf.dat

    --skip NUMBER

      Do not write CPU stats if file already exists and is newer than this
      many seconds. Useful if you refresh tmux status quite frequently.

CAVEAT

 Time remaining

    If the --remaining option is present but you do not see the time in
    your status bar, you may need to increase the value of
    status-right-length to 48.

 Color scheme

    If you only see the memory usage bars but no CPU utilization chart,
    that's because your terminal's color scheme need an explicit
    distinction between foreground and background colors. For instance,
    "red on red background" will be displayed as a red block on such
    terminals. Thus, you may need the ANSI bright attribute for greater
    contrast, or maybe consider switching to the 256-color palette. There
    are some issues with that, though:

      1. Other color schemes (notably, solarized
      <http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized>) have different meaning for
      the ANSI bright attribute. So using it will result in a quite
      psychedelic appearance. 256-color pallette, activated by the --rgb
      flag, is unaffected by that.

      2. The older versions of Term::ANSIColor dependency do not recognize
      bright/RGB settings, falling back to the default behavior (plain 16
      colors). However, the whole Term::ANSIColor is optional, it is only
      required to preview the effects of the "OPTIONS" via command line
      before actually editing the ~/.tmux.conf. That is, rainbarf --bright
      --tmux is guaranteed to work despite the outdated Term::ANSIColor!

    Another option is skipping the system colors altogether and use the RGB
    palette (rainbarf --rgb). This fixes the issue 1, but doesn't affect
    the issue 2. It still looks better, though.

 Persistent storage

    CPU utilization stats are persistently stored in the ~/.rainbarf.dat
    file. Every rainbarf execution will update and rotate that file. Since
    tmux calls rainbarf periodically (every 15 seconds, by default), the
    chart will display CPU utilization for the last ~9.5 minutes (15 * 38).
    Thus, several tmux instances running simultaneously for the same user
    will result in a faster chart scrolling.

 screen

    Stable screen version unfortunately has a broken UTF-8 handling
    specifically for the status bar. Thus, I have only tested the rainbarf
    with the variant from git://git.savannah.gnu.org/screen.git. My
    ~/.screenrc contents:

     backtick 1 15 15 rainbarf --bright --screen
     hardstatus string "%1`"
     hardstatus lastline
